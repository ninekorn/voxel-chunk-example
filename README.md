# voxel-chunk-example
voxel chunk with instanced "integer chunk" for an alternative to using a buffer to update the instanced vertex position.The idea is great, but the performance suffers greatly. trololol.

i have built this program by myself using sharpdx and the ab3d.oculusWrap. this is a wpf version supposedly but it aint using xaml.
