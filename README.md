OCULUS RIFT CV1 ONLY
# voxel-chunk-example
voxel chunk with instanced "integer chunk" for an alternative to using an additional buffer for the shader to update the instanced vertex position.The idea is great, but the performance suffers greatly. trololol.

i have built this program by myself using sharpdx and the ab3d.oculusWrap. this is a wpf version supposedly but it aint using xaml.

I originally posted this on the stackoverflow website here:

I took as reference Craig Perko's C# old Minecraft tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpHQ-Kykp_s&ab_channel=CraigPerko in order to build the triangles and faces and vertices for the chunks. The things i have added is a simple integer that starts with a 1 and then adding a 1 or a 0 if the chunk byte/face is transparent or not. I could 
gave used floats or vectors or matrices to pass on the data to the shader but i read somewhere on the web that using integers in
c# isn't a bad thing. I was having strange results when using the "floor" or "ceil" in hlsl and i would never get the right chunk byte out of a float or from the vectors or matrices. so i came out with the idea to send a long integer that gets the byte 0 or 1 if a face is supposed to be shown. I will work towards trying and getting a version from multiple floats in the vertex bindings and out of a vector or a matrix to see if i can just put in much more chunk data, whenever i have the chance to code that.

thank you for reading me.

Here is what it looks like... It looks like a normal chunk, but its made of instanced chunks where the chunk integer sent as vertex bindings to the shader with 0s or 1s decide of the triangles to be displayed or not from within the shader itself. It's of very poor performance as the vertexes and triangles that aren't visible on the screen are still drawn. I thought using a Geometry shader would make me able to remove the surplus vertices but, thats not really working...
I'm going to try and find an alternative.
